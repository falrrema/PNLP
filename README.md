# Project NLP

Project NLP or **PNLP** is our answer to Kaggle "Quora Question Pairs" competition. We are a team of enthusiastic data scientists and machine learners that are in not for the money but for learning. We vary in knowledge and skills, but we believe that good team work, excellent work and great motivation are key to sucess.
